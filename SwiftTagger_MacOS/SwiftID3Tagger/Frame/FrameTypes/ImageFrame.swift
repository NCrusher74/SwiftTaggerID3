/*
 v2.2
 This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
 Image format is preferably "PNG" [PNG] or "JPG" [JFIF]. Description
 is a short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
 textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
 but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
 each in their individual "PIC" frame, but only one with the same
 content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
 type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is a
 possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'image
 format' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
 The use of linked files should however be used restrictively since
 there is the risk of separation of files.

 v2.3, v2.4
 This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
 Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
 the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
 implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
 should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
 short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
 textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
 but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
 each in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same
 content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
 type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
 possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
 type' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
 The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
 is the risk of separation of files.
